            <p id = "text">This visualization displays the PMV index, which measures comfortability as a function of various weather effects. The intent is for users to be able to identify the best and worst conditions of the day, so that they can plan their dress and activities accordingly<br><br>I chose this measurement scheme because I wanted to experiment with efficent data communication. "Comfort" is a way in which complex data, in this case weather, can be distilled into a simple number or word. While we lose some understanding of the details, the accessibility is enhanced.</p>

        <h2>Visualization 2</h2>
        <div id="vis2">
            <p id="location">Cambridge<br>Today & Tomorrow</p>
            <div id = "plot2"></div>
        </div>
        <p id = "text">This visualization displays each of the subsequent 48 hours as an ellipse. One radius indicates precipitation, and the other indicates wind direction. The orientation of this axis is the wind bearing. The color indicates temperature.<br><br>This design changed slightly from my plan, as I found the use of space in a matrix layout more visually appealing. It also allowed for me to incorporate wind data. I think it would be fun to compare diagrams such as these between places around the world, to see how they are similar and different.</p>
